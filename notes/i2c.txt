Physical setup:

. use i2c-2 bus via pins 23/24 on beagle expansion header, 23 = SDA, 24 = SCL
don't forget level shifters. sparkfun level shifters are bidirectional on tx
pins, not rx pins.

to test if i2c-2 is working/has devices:
$ i2cdetect -r 2




$ sudo modprobe i2c_dev
$ ls /dev/i2c-*
/dev/i2c-1
/dev/i2c-3
 ... /dev/i2c-2 is the one exposed by the expansion header, so need a kernel/u-boot that enables i2c-2

uname = 3.2.16-omap
